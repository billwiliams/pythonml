PYTHONML
==============
###Python adaptation of the coursera's Machine Learning course  taught by Professa Andrew Ng###
This is the python adaptation of the machine learning course taught by professa Andrew Ng .
The codes are translated by Ndirangu Wilson craigvanwilson@gmail.com and are made to replicate the functionality of the ones provided by coursera and written in octave\Matlab
###*NOTE*###
1. The codes contained are not in any way affiliated to coursera and neither is the author/programmer a coursera staff nor working for coursera
+ Python 2.7.6 was used during the creation of the scripts.Generally this should be compatible with any python 2.7.x but cant guarantee functionality  in python 3.x.x
+ Numpy version 1.8.1 was used during the code creation
Intro
-------
The following python tools and modules are recquired to replicate the Octave\Matlab functionality
  1. Numpy (Numerical Python) : A python module used for linear algebra  computations 
  * Pylab : A python  plotting module to help with 2d plotting 
  * Ipython : An interactive python shell that has way more functionality than the standard python shell and is great while executing scripts
