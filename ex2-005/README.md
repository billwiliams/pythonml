  2. costfunctionReg.py - contains code for  the cost function to minimize
  3. plotDecisionBoundary - contains code for plotting the decision boundary 
  4. ex2Data2.txt - file containing the data for logistic regression with regularization

### uses of logistic regression ###
1. It is used extensively in numerous disciplines, including the medical and social science fields. For example, the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS), which is widely used to predict mortality in injured patients, was originally developed by Boyd et al. using logistic regression.

2. Logistic regression might be used to predict whether a patient has a given disease (e.g. diabetes), based on observed characteristics of the patient (age, gender, body mass index, results of various blood tests, etc.).

3. The technique can also be used in engineering, especially for predicting the probability of failure of a given process, system or product.It is also used in marketing applications such as prediction of a customer's propensity to purchase a product or cease a subscription, etc.

4. In economics it can be used to predict the likelihood of a person's choosing to be in the labor force, and a business application would be to predict the likehood of a homeowner defaulting on a mortgage.

5. Conditional random fields, an extension of logistic regression to sequential data, are used in natural language processing.
